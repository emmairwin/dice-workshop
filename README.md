#Diversity Identity Core Engagement (DICE) Workshop

This is a repository of materials and WIP for a workshop intended to
explore and grow diversity awareness in the Mozilla project.  The hope 
is that these tools and techniques could be useful in many contexts, both 
within technical communities and outside as well.  There is, however, a focus
on working with people in a community that has a particular mission where
participants (both paid and unpaid contributors) represent a wide variety 
of backgrounds and intersections of race, gender, class, sexual orientation, 
ability, religion, as well as other identities and core values.

The goal of this repo is to organize materials from instances of the workshop
taking place in various cities and communities.

Please submit pull requests with your slides, additional questions, localized
content, and a write up of how the workshop went when you ran it, based on the
basic questionaire for workshop leaders.
