 - Create a database of forward/backward questions and cultural/localized versions of questions that can be pulled for particular workshops
 - Mention awareness that some things may go either way (in terms of privilege) so forward/backward is a simplified linear metric only for demonstration
 - Have some part of this be done in WebRTC with a partner
 - More work on remote participation
 - Online grid for remote participation with -/+ so they get a 'number'
 - More explanation of the Core Diagram, the Mozilla Core Values
 - Integrate exercised from http://intraweb.stockton.edu/eyos/affirmative_action/content/docs/Interactive%20Diversity%20Booklet%2010-14-2011.pdf
 - Create materials for the DICE game (two blank polyhedral dice that can be written on during the last exercise and played with at the end for closure)
