#Diversity Identity Core Engagement (DICE)

### Intro

The workshop leader should explain about the Diversity & Inclusion Working group, why this is core to Mozilla's mission, and why this exercise. This exercise is about exploring the layers in us from our belief in the core Mozilla values all the way out to our own unique identities and beliefs.

### Design an Alliance

Design alliance about our participation - quick pulse to ask people what do they need to be present and participate fully in the following interactive activity that asks us to share personal interests and  contributions that are core to Mozilla.

Give examples, guidelines - how do we hear, enable and respect others participation

* Male presenting people can wait a beat for women to speak up
* White folks can wait for non-white to speak up
* Anyone who talks a lot can wait for people who haven't spoken to talk
* No cross-talk, don't interrupt
* Trust  & believe people's experiences - you don't have to understand, may  be uncomfortable, doesn't mean it's not true or doesn't exist - learn  more later on your own & with your peers
* Don't  ask people to explain oppression to you, there's lots of material out  there - be an ally, do the work don't ask others to do it for you
* Respect  confidentiality - in these sessions people will be vulnerable, what  happens in sessions stays in session (unless permission from speaker is  given)


### Warm Up - Diversity Matrix

From [Diversity Activity booklet](http://intraweb.stockton.edu/eyos/affirmative_action/content/docs/Interactive%20Diversity%20Booklet%2010-14-2011.pdf)

Discussion points:
 This matrix can tell you a lot about your surroundings.
 Often, people find that their intercultural experiences are clustered; in the residence halls for instance. They often also are passive (one-
way) and not interactive.
 Having this information on paper allows us to use them in new ways. Few other events force us to take stock of our multicultural
interchanges.
 Most people don’t bring this information into their consciousness. They subconsciously are convinced that they are fairly multicultural. It
can be jarring to discover how homogenous our environment is and our environment has had and continues to have an effect on our
beliefs.
 This matrix can give us ideas about how we might enrich our cultural environment and how to reach out to and get to know people who
belong to different groups (Joining a club or community group that includes different kinds of people is an example).


### Stepping Stones

Participants line up in a line, all facing the same direction, with room to both step forward many times (20 steps) and backwards (20 steps). Run through the questions in base questions OR get a set of questions from the database keyed on your location/language once that functionality exists. For now, we just have the base questions and they are North America centric, some questions might want to be removed/replaced by the leader prior to running the workshop.  The goal is to have a fairly even amount of forward & backward step questions. The guiding principle of the questions is that items which would most likely give someone privilege or advantage over others is a 'forward' step while the opposite framing is a 'backward' question.

If working with mix of remote & physical participants, we will provide a grid online (needed) for virtual participants (scale -15 (whatever  number of questions) to 15, and then tape out columns in physical space, number at the top of the column). When complete, people can put their 'number' up on it (the final column you end up in) -- so both local and remote participants can see where each other ends up on this exercise for the discussions later.

### Layers

Share Core Diagram Image (see images folder) and explain the 4 layers [todo - more on this]. Share Mozilla Core Values.

Form Groups of 3-4 people.
If remote participation is involved, get into video chats, text/audio as backup if no video.  Try to put a remote participant into each group as best you can, so all groups have to work with that constraint.

The following is done within each group:

1. Starting with the outer circle ring, everyone write down up to 5 activities that are specific to you. (Give people 5 minutes to write that down.)

2. Ask people to share. Build excitement and momentum by having people share +1 or share similar ones. (Do for about 5 minutes.)

3. Ask people to share any others that they think it's so specific to them  that they probably don't think others do this. (example - "I teach  people who are afraid of heights to do sky diving." wild example, I  know.) The purpose of this is to create a safe space for people to share things that they think probably no one cares about, but where they may find allies. It is about building connection.

4. Move on to the Second Circle Ring and ask people to write up to 5 things. (5 minutes.)

5. Ask people to compare the first 5 with the second 5 and notice if any interests were duplicated. (Discuss, 5-7 minutes)

6. Repeat for Third Circle Ring:  Contributions to Mozilla. Discuss did any interests move over from the first rung through the third. Build momentum by having people share their contributions to Mozilla, and noting the diversity of what people are contributing. The purpose of this is to celebrate and recognize each  other. (10 minutes)

7. The most challenging - Have People check themselves against the Mozilla core values, recognize how they internalize each, then write about how those are reflected in their contributions as Mozillians.  (10 minutes)

8. At this time, pause and let people reflect. (15 minute, perhaps a bio-break)

9. Gather back together. Ask if people will share what they learned through this activity. Note the similarities between groups, or differences.

### Wrap Up

Provide a link to tool kits, invite people to join the diversity working group if they are interested in further development and leadership in this area. Give everyone a badge.

(would be nice to have an exit survey here)
